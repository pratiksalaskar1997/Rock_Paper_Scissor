# Rock_Paper_Scissor

In this i code for a game which is Rock Paper Scissor,
normal while playing with this game different criteria are there,
e.g
Suppose we have two persond person 1 and person 2
in first round person 1 raise ==> Rock
Simultaneously person 2 raise ==> Scissor 
then in result of this Rock win

in second round person 1 raise ==> paper
Simultaneously person 2 raise ==> Scissor 
then in result of this Scissor win

in Third round person 1 raise ==> Rock
Simultaneously person 2 raise ==> Paper 
then in result of this Paper win

in Fourth round person 1 raise ==> Rock
Simultaneously person 2 raise ==> Rock 
then in result of this Draw

the same condition apply in my code.
and system shows who win with how many point
